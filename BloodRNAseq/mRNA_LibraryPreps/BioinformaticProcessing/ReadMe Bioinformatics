Process.
1. If an individual has more than 1 R1 and R2 files, then concatenate all the R1 files from an individual, and all the R2 files from an indiviudal. Put in a new folder for easy processing.
2. Run FASTQC and evaluate what cleanning is needed. Pay particular attention to adpater.
  Can use dthe 1_Driver script to do this as an array job.
  Run MultiQC on the fastqc folder to get summary across all the FASTQC outputs
3. Run the pipelien - can use the 2_Driver script to do as an array job
  - Trim (Trimmomatic)
  - Run Fastqc on cleaned data
  - Map to NCBI reference genome (HiSat2)
  - Process Sam to Bam; Sort Bam, Index, Stats (Samtools)
  - Count the mapped reads to gene (Stringtie)
4.   Run MultiQC on the CLEANED fastqc folder to get summary across all the FASTQC outputs
     Run prepDE.py on the Stringtie folder to combine the genecounts into a single file to use for statistical analyes.
